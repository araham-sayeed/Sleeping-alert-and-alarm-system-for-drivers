This is an ML-IoT-based Drowsiness Detection System that identifies driver fatigue using eye closure and yawning detection. It leverages OpenCV, dlib, and Raspberry Pi for real-time face and landmark detection. A buzzer alert system is integrated to warn drowsy drivers, preventing accidents. The project utilizes facial landmark detection to monitor eye aspect ratio (EAR) and lip distance, triggering alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
